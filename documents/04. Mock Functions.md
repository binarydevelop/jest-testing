## Mock Functions

Mock functions allow you to test the links between code by erasing the actual implementation of a function, capturing calls to the function (and the parameters passed in those calls), capturing instances of constructor functions when instantiated with new, and allowing test-time configuration of return values.

There are two ways to mock functions: Either by creating a mock function to use in test code, or writing a manual mock to override a module dependency.

Let's imagine we're testing an implementation of a function forEach, which invokes a callback for each item in a supplied array.
```js
function forEach(items, callback) {
  for (let index = 0; index < items.length; index++) {
    callback(items[index]);
  }
}
```
To test this function, we can use a mock function, and inspect the mock's state to ensure the callback is invoked as expected.
```js
const mockCallback = jest.fn(x => 42 + x);
forEach([0, 1], mockCallback);

// The mock function is called twice
expect(mockCallback.mock.calls.length).toBe(2);

// The first argument of the first call to the function was 0
expect(mockCallback.mock.calls[0][0]).toBe(0);

// The first argument of the second call to the function was 1
expect(mockCallback.mock.calls[1][0]).toBe(1);

// The return value of the first call to the function was 42
expect(mockCallback.mock.results[0].value).toBe(42);
```

### .mock Property 

#### bind in Js
The ``bind()`` method creates a new function that, when called, has its this keyword set to the provided value, with a given sequence of arguments preceding any provided when the new function is called.
```js
let c1 = {
    x: 24,
    y: 67
}

function showCoordinates(){
    this.z = 78;
    console.log(this.x, ' ', this.y, ' ', this.z)
}

showCoordinates(); // undefined undefined 78
showCoordinates.bind(c1)(); // 24 67 78 
let boundCoordinates = showCoordinates.bind(c1);
boundCoordinates(); // 24 67 78
```

All mock functions have this special .mock property, which is where data about how the function has been called and what the function returned is kept. The .mock property also tracks the value of this for each call, so it is possible to inspect this as well:


To create a mock we simply do 
```js
const newMock = jest.fn();

//To call that with arguments
newMock('','')

// To return a value from the mock
const newMock = jest.fn(() => "return value");

// To make the mock function return different values we can do like: 
newMock.mockReturnValueOnce("return first").mockReturnValueOnce("return second")
```
