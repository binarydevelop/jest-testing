## Mock Functions

Mock functions allow you to test the links between code by erasing the actual implementation of a function, capturing calls to the function (and the parameters passed in those calls), capturing instances of constructor functions when instantiated with new, and allowing test-time configuration of return values.

There are two ways to mock functions: Either by creating a mock function to use in test code, or writing a manual mock to override a module dependency.

Let's imagine we're testing an implementation of a function forEach, which invokes a callback for each item in a supplied array.
```js
function forEach(items, callback) {
  for (let index = 0; index < items.length; index++) {
    callback(items[index]);
  }
}
```
To test this function, we can use a mock function, and inspect the mock's state to ensure the callback is invoked as expected.
```js
const mockCallback = jest.fn(x => 42 + x);
forEach([0, 1], mockCallback);

// The mock function is called twice
expect(mockCallback.mock.calls.length).toBe(2);

// The first argument of the first call to the function was 0
expect(mockCallback.mock.calls[0][0]).toBe(0);

// The first argument of the second call to the function was 1
expect(mockCallback.mock.calls[1][0]).toBe(1);

// The return value of the first call to the function was 42
expect(mockCallback.mock.results[0].value).toBe(42);
```

### .mock Property 

#### bind in Js
The ``bind()`` method creates a new function that, when called, has its this keyword set to the provided value, with a given sequence of arguments preceding any provided when the new function is called.
```js
let c1 = {
    x: 24,
    y: 67
}

function showCoordinates(){
    this.z = 78;
    console.log(this.x, ' ', this.y, ' ', this.z)
}

showCoordinates(); // undefined undefined 78
showCoordinates.bind(c1)(); // 24 67 78 
let boundCoordinates = showCoordinates.bind(c1);
boundCoordinates(); // 24 67 78
```

All mock functions have this special ``.mock`` property, which is where data about how the function has been called and what the function returned is kept. The ``.mock`` property also tracks the value of ``this`` for each call, so it is possible to inspect this as well:
```js
const myMock = jest.fn(); // creat

const a = new myMock();
const b = {};
const bound = myMock.bind(b);
bound();

console.log(myMock.mock.instances);
// > [ <a>, <b> ]
```

To create a mock we simply do 
```js
const newMock = jest.fn();

//To call that with arguments
newMock('','')

// To return a value from the mock
const newMock = jest.fn(() => "return value");

// To make the mock function return different values we can do like: 
newMock.mockReturnValueOnce("return first").mockReturnValueOnce("return second")
```

These ``mock`` members are very useful in tests to assert how these functions get called, instantiated, or what they returned. 


### Mocking Modules
Suppose we have a class that fetches users from our API. The class uses ``axios`` to call the API then returns the data attribute which contains all the users:
```js
// users.js
const axios = require('axios');

class Users {
  static all() {
    return axios.get('/users.json').then(resp => resp.data);
  }
}

module.exports = Users;
```
Now, in order to test this method without actually hitting the API , we can use the ``jest.mock(...)`` function to automatically mock the ``axios`` module.

Once we mock the module we can provide a mockResolvedValue for .get that returns the data we want our test to assert against. In effect, we are saying that we want axios.get('/users.json') to return a fake response.
```js
// users.test.js
const axios = require('axios');
const Users = require('./users');

jest.mock('axios');

test('should fetch users', () => {
  const users = [{name: 'Bob'}];
  const resp = {data: users};
  axios.get.mockResolvedValue(resp); // here we are mocking the api hit response so the below code will take this data as the return value. 

  // or you could use the following depending on your use case:
  // axios.get.mockImplementation(() => Promise.resolve(resp))

  return Users.all().then(data => expect(data).toEqual(users));
});
```
What we are doing here is in the return line we check for the User class and function all which hits the real api now instead of hitting the real api we are mocking the response and expecting it to be of some structure. 


If we make a class we can access it's functions only by creating an object but if we use ``static`` keyword 
we can use it without creating an object and just using the class. 
```js
//user.js
class Cars{

  constructor(brand){
    this.carName = brand;
  }

  hello(){
    console.log('HEllo' + this.carName)
  }

  static staticHello(x){ // if we want to use an object we pass it as a parameter, x here is a Cars Object
    console.log('Hello' + x.carName) 
  }
}

// someFile.js
const Cars = require('./cars')

const BMW = new Cars('xlri');
BMW.hello();
//Error
BMW.staticHello() //throws an Error

Cars.staticHello(BMW) // pass an object of Cars type to static functions
```
``Static`` methods are called directly on the class (Car from the example above) - without creating an instance/object (mycar) of the class.

### Mocking Partials

Subsets of a module can be mocked and the rest of the module can keep their actual implementation:
```js
// foo-bar-baz.js
export const foo = 'foo';
export const bar = () => 'bar';
export default () => 'baz';
```
```js
//test.js
import defaultExport, {bar, foo} from '../foo-bar-baz';

jest.mock('../foo-bar-baz', () => {
  const originalModule = jest.requireActual('../foo-bar-baz');

  //Mock the default export and named export 'foo'
  return {
    __esModule: true,
    ...originalModule,
    default: jest.fn(() => 'mocked baz'),
    foo: 'mocked foo',
  };
});

test('should do a partial mock', () => {
  const defaultExportResult = defaultExport();
  expect(defaultExportResult).toBe('mocked baz');
  expect(defaultExport).toHaveBeenCalled();

  expect(foo).toBe('mocked foo');
  expect(bar()).toBe('bar');
});
```

When we mock module we just do, 
```js
jest.mock('axios')
```
But when we mock a module or class we do 
```js
jest.mock('./someModule', () => {
  // function1: () => ...
  // ..
})
```
> Note: When we use the () after your => it just automatically returns the values inside.

### Mock Implementations
There are cases where it's useful to go beyond the ability to specify return values and full-on replace the implementation of a mock function. This can be done with ``jest.fn`` or the ``mockImplementationOnce`` method on mock functions.

What we do is actually change the implementation as well inside a mock function as well as change the return value. 

The mockImplementation method is useful when we need to define the default implementation of a mock function that is created from another module:
```js
//foo.js
module.exports = function () {
  // some implementation;
};
```
```js
// test.js
jest.mock('../foo'); // this happens automatically with automocking
const foo = require('../foo');

// foo is a mock function
foo.mockImplementation(() => 42);
foo();
// > 42
```

When we need to recreate a complex behaviour of mock functions such that multiple function calls produce different results we use the ``mockImplementationOnce`` method. 
```js
const myMockFn = jest
  .fn(() => 'default')
  .mockImplementationOnce(cb => cb(null, true))
  .mockImplementationOnce(cb => cb(null, false));

myMockFn((err, val) => console.log(val));
// > true

myMockFn((err, val) => console.log(val));
// > false
```

And when it runs out of the ``mockImplementationOnce`` it will execute the default implementation set with ``jest.fn()``
```js
console.log(myMockFn(), myMockFn(), myMockFn(), myMockFn());
// > 'first call', 'second call', 'default', 'default'
```
For cases where we have methods that are typically chained (and thus always need to return this), we have a sugary API to simplify this in the form of a ``.mockReturnThis()`` function that also sits on all mocks:
```js
const myObj = {
  myMethod: jest.fn().mockReturnThis(),
};

// is the same as

const otherObj = {
  myMethod: jest.fn(function () {
    return this;
  }),
};
```

### Mock Names
Mock Names are provided to quickly identify the mock calls
 ```js
     test('mock Names', () => {
        const myMockFn = jest
        .fn()
        .mockReturnValue('default')
        .mockImplementation(scalar => 42 + scalar)
        .mockName('add');

        // expect(myMockFn).toBeCalled(); 
        // will throw error with the name provided
    })
 ```

### Custome Matchers
Finally, in order to make it less demanding to assert how mock functions have been called, we've some custom matcher functions:

```js
// The mock function was called at least once
expect(mockFunc).toHaveBeenCalled();

// The mock function was called at least once with the specified args
expect(mockFunc).toHaveBeenCalledWith(arg1, arg2);

// The last call to the mock function was called with the specified args
expect(mockFunc).toHaveBeenLastCalledWith(arg1, arg2);

// All calls and the name of the mock is written as a snapshot
expect(mockFunc).toMatchSnapshot();
```
These matchers are sugar for common forms of inspecting the .mock property.


### Jest.spyOn(Obejct, function)

``Jest.spyOn()`` is used to create mocks as well as spy on mocks of methods 
Suppose we have something like 
```js
const something = {
  doSomething(){
    console.log('hi')
  }
}

const objSpy = jest.spyOn(something, 'doSomething');
something.doSomething();
expect(objSpy).toBeCalled();
```

We can also mock implementation of the function basically it is another way of creating mocks.
